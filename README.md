# Joplin Safari Web Clipper
This is an Safari App Extension for a Joplin Web Clipper. While there are extensions for Chrome and Firefox, with the new "native" approach for Safari extensions, a web clipper did not exist. This is my attempt at making one.

**Please note** - This is very much **ALPHA** quality code at this point. Much of it doesn't work.

## Working
* Clip URL
* Clip Complete Page (to Markdown)
* Folder Selector (although it forgets the last used folder each time)
* Server Status Check (although there is an error if the server is down)

## Not Working/Missing
* Clip Simplified Page
* Clip Selection
* Clip Complete Page (to HTML)
* Clip Image Capture
* Tags

I'm very new at Safari App Extension development, so bear with me as we learn along together!
