# JoplinSafariWebClipper
This is an Safari App Extension for a Joplin Web Clipper. While there are extensions for Chrome and Firefox, with the new "native" approach for Safari extensions, a web clipper did not exist. This is my attempt at making one.

I'm very new at Safari App Extension development, so bear with me as we learn along together!
